    "# GSA tutorial - What are the most important parameters in a mathematical model?\n",
    "Francesca Pianosi, Fanny Sarrazin, Andres Pe√±uela\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical models often encompass a large number of parameters. The value of these parameters for a particular application are decided by the modeller based on information about the quantities that these parameters represent (for example, measurements from field work or from lab experiments). Alternatively, if the modeller possesses some observations of the system' input and output variables, the parameterss can be estimated by finding the values that makes the model best fit those observations (this process is called *model calibration*). \n",
    "In both cases, determining the 'right' parameter values is often difficult and time consuming, as it may require acquiring and handling a lot of data and/or using of a lot of computing power (if the model is calibrated using a computer algorithm). In this Notebook we see how Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can help in this context, by allowing us to determine the relative importance of the parameters on the model predictions, and therefore identify the most influential parameters on which estimation efforts should be focused on.\n",

    "# A hydrological example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook we will apply GSA to determine the influential and uninfluential parameters of a hydrological model. A hydrological model takes time series of meteorological forcings (rainfall and temperature) over a river basin, and returns the time series of river flows at the basin outlet. For the sake of illustration, here we will use a very simple model, the Hymod model (Boyle 2001; Wagener et al. 2001), which only has five parameters. These parameters represent some key basin characteristics that determine the transformation of rainfall into flow, such as the soil's water holding capacity and the velocity with which water travels in the sub-surface. \n",
    "We will apply the model to the Leaf catchment in the USA (Sorooshian et al., 1983), for which we possess daily observations of rainfall (R), potential evaporation (PE) and river flow (Q), which can be used for the model calibration. Specifically, we will measure the model's fit-to-data with two performance metrics: the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the volumetric bias (BIAS). We will show how GSA can be used to quantify the relative importance of the five model parameters in controlling these performance metrics. \n",
